## Core Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Knowledge Base** | Agent learns from your docs, website, or Notion |
| **API Integration** | Agent calls your API to take actions (check orders, cancel subscriptions) |
| **Identity Verification** | Agent knows who the user is and can act on their behalf |
| **Workflows** | Guided multi-step flows for complex tasks |
