Integrations let your agent take actions—not just answer questions.

## Options

| Type | Best for | Setup |
|------|----------|-------|
| [OpenAPI](/openapi) | Your REST API | Upload spec file |
| [Client Side](/client-side-tools) | Browser actions, UI interactions | Upload JSON + register handlers |
| [MCP Servers](/mcp-servers) | Third-party services, complex integrations | Connect server URL |

## When to Use OpenAPI

- You have a REST API with an OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- You want your agent to call your backend (check orders, create tickets, etc.)
- You need to authenticate requests with API keys or user tokens

## When to Use Client Side

- Actions that need browser access (navigation, DOM, local storage)
- UI interactions (show modals, open forms, toggle features)
- Actions that need your app's state (React router, Redux, Zustand)

## When to Use MCP

- Connecting third-party services
- Using pre-built integrations (Notion, etc.)
- Real-time bidirectional communication

## Example Actions

**OpenAPI:**
- Check order status
- Create support tickets
- Look up customer info
- Process refunds

**Client Side:**
- Navigate to pages
- Show upgrade modal
- Add items to cart
- Toggle dark mode

**MCP:**
- Search Notion pages
- Query databases
- Access Google Drive
