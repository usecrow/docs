Integrations let your agent take actions—not just answer questions.

## Server-Side Tools

These are tools that run on a server. The agent calls them, they execute, and results come back.

| Type | Best for | Setup |
|------|----------|-------|
| [Envoy CLI](/envoy) | Any backend — auto-generates and hosts an MCP server | `npx @usecrow/envoy` |
| [Connect Your MCP Server](/server-side-mcp) | You already have an MCP server deployed | Enter URL in dashboard |
| [OpenAPI](/openapi) | You have an OpenAPI/Swagger spec | Upload spec file |

<Tip>
**Start with Envoy** if you don't have an MCP server yet. It reads your code and generates one for you.
</Tip>

## Client-Side Tools

Tools that run in the user's browser. The agent calls them, the widget executes them locally.

| Type | Best for |
|------|----------|
| [Client-Side Tools](/client-side-tools) | Browser actions (navigation, UI updates, local data) |
| [Tool Renderers](/tool-renderers) | Custom UI for tool results (charts, tables) |

## External MCP Servers

Third-party MCP servers that you connect to (not your own backend).

| Type | Best for |
|------|----------|
| [MCP Servers](/mcp-servers) | Third-party services (Notion, databases, etc.) |
