Integrations let your agent take actions—not just answer questions.

## Server-Side Tools

These are tools that run on a server. The agent calls them, they execute, and results come back.

| Type | Best for | Setup |
|------|----------|-------|
| [Envoy CLI](/envoy) | Any backend — auto-generates an MCP server | `npx @usecrow/envoy` |
| [OpenAPI](/openapi) | Your REST API with a spec file | Upload OpenAPI/Swagger spec |
| [Server-Side MCP](/server-side-mcp) | Your backend via MCP protocol | Run an MCP server, connect URL |

### When to Use Envoy (Recommended)

- You want to get tools working in minutes, not hours
- You have a standard REST backend and don't want to write MCP code
- You want Crow to host and manage the MCP server for you

### When to Use OpenAPI

- You already have an OpenAPI/Swagger spec
- You want simple endpoint calls (check orders, create tickets)
- You need API Key, Bearer Token, or JWT Forward auth

### When to Use Server-Side MCP

- You want full control over tool definitions and hosting
- Your tools need complex server-side logic beyond API wrapping
- You need custom auth flows or identity forwarding

<Note>
OpenAPI and Server-Side MCP are **mutually exclusive** per product. Envoy generates and hosts an MCP server for you, so it works alongside either approach.
</Note>

## Client-Side Tools

Tools that run in the user's browser. The agent calls them, the widget executes them locally.

| Type | Best for |
|------|----------|
| [Client-Side Tools](/client-side-tools) | Browser actions (navigation, UI updates, local data) |
| [Tool Renderers](/tool-renderers) | Custom UI for tool results (charts, tables) |

## External MCP Servers

Third-party MCP servers that you connect to (not your own backend).

| Type | Best for |
|------|----------|
| [MCP Servers](/mcp-servers) | Third-party services (Notion, databases, etc.) |
