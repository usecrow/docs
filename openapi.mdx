Upload an OpenAPI (Swagger) spec to let your agent call your API endpoints.

## Setup

### 1. Configure Connection

In **Integration** → **OpenAPI**:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Base URL** | Your API root (e.g., `https://api.yourcompany.com/v1`) |
| **Auth Type** | None, API Key, Bearer Token, or JWT Forward |

### 2. Configure Auth

<CodeGroup>

```text API Key
Header name: X-API-Key
Value: your-secret-key
```

```text Bearer Token
Value: your-bearer-token
```

```text JWT Forward
No config needed—token comes from authenticated widget user.
Requires Identity Verification setup.
```

</CodeGroup>

### 3. Upload Spec

Drag and drop your `.json` or `.yaml` OpenAPI spec file.

### 4. Enable Tools

Go to [Actions](https://app.usecrow.ai/actions) and select which endpoints to enable.

## Example Spec

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: My API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /orders/{orderId}:
    get:
      operationId: getOrder
      summary: Get order details
      parameters:
        - name: orderId
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Order details
```

## Client-Side Tools

For browser-side actions (navigation, UI interactions), use the dedicated [Client Side](/client-side-tools) integration instead of OpenAPI.

<Note>
**Legacy support:** Tools previously defined in OpenAPI with a `/client/` server URL will continue to work and appear under Client-Side Tools in Actions. We recommend migrating to the dedicated Client Side integration for cleaner separation.
</Note>

## Tips

- Use descriptive `summary` and `description` fields
- Use clear `operationId` names (`getOrderStatus` not `get1`)
- Only expose safe operations

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Spec won't upload | Validate at [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io) |
| API calls failing | Check base URL and auth credentials |
| Agent not using API | Enable tools in Actions, test in Sandbox |
