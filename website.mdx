Automatically crawl your website so your agent can reference its content.

## Setup

1. Enter your website URL (e.g., `https://docs.yourcompany.com`)
2. Click **Ingest**
3. Crow crawls linked pages on the same domain

## What Gets Crawled

**Included:**
- Publicly accessible pages
- Pages linked from starting URL
- Same domain only

**Not included:**
- Password-protected pages
- Pages blocked by robots.txt
- External domains
- JavaScript-rendered content

## Re-indexing

When content changes:

2. Enter URL again
3. Click **Ingest**

<Warning>
Re-indexing replaces previous content.

## Tips

- Use your docs subdomain for focused content (`docs.yourcompany.com`)
- Re-index after major content updates
- Test in Sandbox to verify content is accessible
