title: "External MCP Servers"
description: "Connect third-party MCP servers to your agent"
---

Connect third-party MCP servers to give your agent access to external services like Notion, databases, and more.

<Note>
Looking to connect **your own backend** as an MCP server? See [Server-Side MCP](/server-side-mcp) instead. This page is for connecting **external** MCP servers you don't control.
</Note>

<Info>
**What are MCP tools?** MCP is an open standard that lets AI agents connect to external services. By adding an MCP server, your Crow agent gains access to all tools that server exposes—no custom code required.
</Info>

**Example use cases:**
- Connect a database MCP server so your agent can query customer data
- Add a CRM server so your agent can look up and update contacts
- Integrate internal APIs that already have MCP endpoints

## Add a Server

1. Go to [Integration](https://app.usecrow.ai/integration)
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Fill in:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Server Name** | Friendly name (e.g., `customer-api`) |
| **Server URL** | MCP endpoint URL |
| **Transport** | Streamable HTTP (recommended) or SSE |
| **Headers** | Optional auth headers (`Key: Value`) |

4. Click **Test Connection**
5. Save

## Managing Servers

- **Enable/Disable** — Toggle without removing
- **View Tools** — Expand to see available tools
- **Edit** — Change URL, transport, headers
- **Delete** — Remove entirely

## Configuring Tools

After connecting, go to [Actions](https://app.usecrow.ai/actions) to enable or disable individual tools for your agent. Only enabled tools will be available when your agent responds to users.

## Pre-built Integrations

**Notion** — Connect via **Knowledge Base** → **Notion** (uses MCP under the hood)

**Coming soon:** Slack, GitHub, Google Drive

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Connection failed | Verify URL, check headers, try other transport |
| Tools not appearing | Expand server to trigger discovery |
| Agent not using tools | Enable in Actions, test in Sandbox |
